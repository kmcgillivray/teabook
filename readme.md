# Teabook :tea:

Teabook is a command line tea journal written in ruby. Track information about your tea explorations including:

* Name of tea
* Date brewed
* Type of tea
* Geographic origin of tea
* Retailer source
* Steeping method and notes

## Getting started

1. Clone or [download](http://github.com/kmcgillivray/teabook/archive/master.zip) this repository.
2. Navigate to the downloaded directory in Terminal (or your command line tool of choice)
3. Run `ruby teabook.rb`

## To do

- [ ] Generate an empty data file that isn't tracked in Git (rather than downloading my personal data file)
- [ ] Add additional tea data: date, steeping notes, origin and source
- [ ] Make executable gem?
